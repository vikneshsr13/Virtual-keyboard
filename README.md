Virtual Keyboard using OpenCV and MediaPipe

Overview

This project implements a Virtual Keyboard using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It allows users to type using hand gestures, making it useful for touchless interaction in various applications.


Features

Hand Tracking: Uses MediaPipe to track hand movements.

Gesture Detection: Recognizes finger positions to simulate key presses.

OpenCV Interface: Displays a virtual keyboard with real-time interaction.

Customizable Layout: Modify the keyboard layout as per requirement.

Sound Feedback: Optional audio feedback on key press.


Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV (for image processing)

MediaPipe (for hand tracking)

NumPy (for numerical operations)



Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install required libraries:

pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pygame


How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/virtual-keyboard.git
cd virtual-keyboard

Run the Python script:

python virtual_keyboard.py

The virtual keyboard interface should appear. Move your hand in front of the camera to interact.


Usage Instructions

Place your hand in front of the webcam.

Position your index finger over a key to press it.

Adjust the hand height for sensitivity control.

Press ESC to exit the application.


Customization

Modify the keyboard_layout list in virtual_keyboard.py to change the key arrangement.

Adjust detection sensitivity in the gesture_detection function.

Troubleshooting

Hand not detected? Ensure proper lighting and avoid complex backgrounds.

Key presses not registering? Adjust the detection threshold in the script.

Laggy performance? Reduce frame resolution or optimize gesture processing.


Future Improvements

Implement machine learning for better gesture recognition.

Add support for multiple gestures and shortcuts.

Enhance UI with additional customization options.
